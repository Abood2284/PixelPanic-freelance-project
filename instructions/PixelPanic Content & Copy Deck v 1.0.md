# PixelPanic Content \& Copy Deck v 1.0

_A master reference for every word the product speaks, from SEO snippets to button micro-copy._

## 1. Voice Overview

Tone = Motivational + Trustworthy + Mumbai-local.
Style rules:

- Write in second person (“you”), contractions allowed, max 16 words per sentence for marketing copy.
- Always pair a promise with a proof (stat, warranty, or time guarantee).
- Sprinkle light Hinglish in headers only where it boosts relatability (“Bilkul no tension”).
