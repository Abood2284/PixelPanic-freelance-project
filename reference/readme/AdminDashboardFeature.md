# PixelPanic Admin Dashboard: Feature Roadmap

_Version 2.0 - January 27, 2025_

This document outlines the phased development plan for the PixelPanic Admin Dashboard. The goal is to evolve the dashboard from a simple data-entry tool into a comprehensive operational hub that provides full control and visibility over our business processes.

## Core Pillars

The dashboard's features will be structured around three core business functions:

1.  **Operations**: Real-time management of day-to-day activities like repair orders.
2.  **Management**: Tools for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on our core data like pricing, technicians, and customers.
3.  **Analytics**: Dashboards and reports to turn our data into actionable business insights.

## Database Schema

The admin dashboard works with the following database tables:

### **Core Tables**

- **`orders`**: Repair orders with customer, technician, and status information
- **`users`**: User accounts with role-based access (admin, technician, customer)
- **`technicians`**: Technician profiles with performance metrics
- **`technician_invites`**: Token-based invitation system for onboarding
- **`brands`**: Phone brands with logos and metadata
- **`models`**: Phone models linked to brands
- **`issues`**: Repair services and issues
- **`model_issues`**: Pricing matrix linking models to services
- **`addresses`**: Customer service addresses for doorstep repairs

### **Key Relationships**

- Orders link to users (customers), technicians, and addresses
- Models belong to brands and have multiple service prices
- Technicians are users with the 'technician' role
- Invitations create secure onboarding links for new technicians
